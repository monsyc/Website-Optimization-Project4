OPTIMIZATIONS 

I CHANGED THE LINE 552 INSTEAD OF HAVING 200 PIZZAS, NOW THE PROGRAM HAS 20 AND THE APP IS FASTE.

FOR THE UPDATE POSITION FUNCTION I CHANGED THE QUERYSELECTORALL TO GETELEMENTSBYCLASSNAME, BECAUSE IS MORE ESPECIFIC, 
ALSO I ADDED MORE VARIABLES BECAUSE THIS MAKE FASTER THE APP

I ALSO FIND THAT THE FUNCTION CHANGESLIDEDSIZES NEED TO BE FIXED AND I LEFT THE CODE THAT I NEED TO PUT IN COMMENTS BECAUSE IT DIDN'T WORK WELL.

ALSO FOR THE PAINT OPTIMIZATION I ADDED IN THE STYLE.CSS FILE, IN THE .MOVER THE WILL-CHANGE: TRANSFORM;

NOW THE APP RUN FASTER.
